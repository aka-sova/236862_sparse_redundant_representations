    # Solves the following problem:
    #   min_{alpha_i} \sum_i ||y_i - D alpha_i||_2^2 
    #                   s.t. || alpha_i ||_0 = K for all i,
    # where D is a dictionary of size n X n, y_i are the input signals of
    # length n, and K stands for the number of nonzeros allows per each alpha_i
    # 
    # The above can be equally written as follows:
    #   min_{A} \sum_i ||Y - DA||_F^2 
    #             s.t. || alpha_i ||_0 = K for all i,
    # where Y is a matrix that contains the y_i patches as its columns.

    # as its columns
    #
    # The solution is returned in the matrix A, along with the denoised signals
    # given by  X = DA.
