    # In the x-update step of the ADMM we use the Cholesky factorization for
    # solving efficiently a given linear system Ax=b. The idea of this
    # factorization is to decompose a symmetric positive-definite matrix A
    # by A = L*L^T = L*U, where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is
    # its transpose. Given L and U, we can solve Ax = b by first solving
    # Ly = b for y by forward substitution, and then solving Ux = y
    # for x by back substitution.
    # To conclude, given A and b, where A is symmetric and positive-definite,
    # we first compute L using Numpy's command L = np.linalg.cholesky( A, 'lower' );
    # and get U by setting U = L'; Then, we obtain x via x = U \ (L \ b);
    # Note that the matrix A is fixed along the iterations of the ADMM
    # (and so as L and U). Therefore, in order to reduce computations,
    # we compute its decomposition once.
